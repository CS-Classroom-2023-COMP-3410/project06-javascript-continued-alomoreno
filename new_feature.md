New feature attempted: 
The new feature I attempted to add was to slowly work up to an interactive to-do list with a calendar feature that shows what days you have tasks in the current and upcoming month, along with all the features that were already included for the original project. 

Reasoning: 
I believed this feature to be reasonable because it enhanced a front-end to do list with a more current "realistic" to do list that can be found.

Intended functionality: 
The to-do list was supposed to have a calendar view, similar to the one that can be found in your phone, where you can see a month view. It was supposed to have small dots on the day a task was due. It was to maintain the current functions, from the previous project, where you can see what tasks are completed, what tasks are pending, and all tasks. Also maintian the feature of dynamically moving the tasks based on the user's priority. 

Issues with ChatGPT: 
At first ChatGPT correctly added the calendar and was able to go months in advance. Once trying to include the dots to represent the tasks on the calendar, issues arose. First the calendar no longer looked like the first attempt, it was a singluar month, and the month wasn't labeled, and the dots that were supposed to represent the tasks were a day behind. After conversating with chat, it would fix the issue I mentioned then add more issues with the already exisiting features.
